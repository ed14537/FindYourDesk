System design:

c. requirements of key sub systems

e. 

If two buttons pressed at once, enter broken mode

Chair can only be confirmed fixed once admin card is scanned
(two buttons are scanned, or some sort of hidden admin 
sequence)


System Implementation:

b, 



Issues encountered:

The iot code was initially created on the m5stick and upon
loading it on to the stack it would not work. The stack would stay stuck the 'in use' state. When the movement threshold values were changed to be higher it
then just stayed in the free state. Debugging was more difficult without a dedicated debugger but we printed the accelerometer values to the serial stream
and found that they were not changing in any of the loops. After comparing with the example accelerometer code we noticed that there was a function (M5.Power.Begin())
in the setup loop that was not being called in the stick code. After adding this the serial output showed the accelerometer values changing!
We realised that this command must power up the accelerometer chip via the I2C bus. On the stick the accelerometer must receive power from the main system so
this was not necessary.


Could possibly have an interface to set up chair ID and room on the stack.
